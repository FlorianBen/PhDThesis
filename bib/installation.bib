  abstract = "We describe the new ion implantation system at Orsay, which operates from 5 to 190 kV. Sixty-five elements from H to U have been implanted in insulators, semiconductors or metals. Significant currents (several μA) of three-fold ionized elements have been implanted at energies up to 570 keV. Details are provided on the target-holders used, particularly on a variable temperature (1.7–300 K) cryostat and a variable temperature (80–300 K) ganiometer, and on an in situ Rutherford back-scattering analysis set-up (using the 380 keV He2+ beam) used in conjunction with all these target-holders. The latter system is used for studies of metastable low-temperature implanted alloys: specific examples will be given."

Its essential features correspond precisely to the scheme described at the last EMIS conference. Therefore the emphasis here will be on the general conception of the separator, on concrete descriptions of particular devices and on corresponding performance. Target experiments are reported in another ISOCELE communication."

Since   the   front   end   is considered  as  the  most  critical  part  of  such  accelerators, the  two  French  national research  agencies  CEA  and CNRS  decided  to  collaborate  to  study  and  build  a  High-Intensity  Proton  Injector  (IPHI).

This statement mainly concerns France with the planned closure of Orphee and ILL. At CEA-Saclay, the project SONATE has been launched in order to provide a high intensity neutron source in Saclay site, this project is based on Compact Accelerator-driven Neutron Sources technology coupled to high-intensity beams. The goal of SONATE is to develop a 50 kW target, aiming to produce at least a neutron yield of 1013 s-1 in pulse mode with a peak current of 100 mA. We have investigated in this document the best combinations of beam/target which would lead to this substantial neutron yields. Further investigations and tests have to be carry out, especially due to sparse data on thick target and such low-energy beams considered in this document. An intermediate step to the SONATE project is under test and development, called IPHI-NEUTRON, which would lead to provide a small-size neutron facility mainly devoted to neutron imagery for industry. This step is based on the existing 3 MeV proton beam, named IPHI. Best target candidates are Lithium and Beryllium, leading respectively to a neutron yield of about 2.1013 s-1 and 4.1012 s-1.}
