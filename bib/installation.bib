  abstract = "We describe the new ion implantation system at Orsay, which operates from 5 to 190 kV. Sixty-five elements from H to U have been implanted in insulators, semiconductors or metals. Significant currents (several μA) of three-fold ionized elements have been implanted at energies up to 570 keV. Details are provided on the target-holders used, particularly on a variable temperature (1.7–300 K) cryostat and a variable temperature (80–300 K) ganiometer, and on an in situ Rutherford back-scattering analysis set-up (using the 380 keV He2+ beam) used in conjunction with all these target-holders. The latter system is used for studies of metastable low-temperature implanted alloys: specific examples will be given."

  abstract  = {High-power    accelerators    are    studied    for    several projects  based  on  high-flux  neutron  sources  driven  by proton   or   deuteron   beams.   Since   the   front   end   is considered  as  the  most  critical  part  of  such  accelerators, the  two  French  national research  agencies  CEA  and CNRS  decided  to  collaborate  to  study  and  build  a  High-Intensity  Proton  Injector  (IPHI).  The  construction  of  this prototype  designed  to  accelerate  beams  up  to  100  mA with an energy up to 10 MeV is now in progress. The first beam  is  scheduled  for  January  2003.  The  different  parts of the accelerator are described. The last results obtained by  the  ECR  source  SILHI,  the  status  of  the  construction as well as the installation schedule are presented.},
