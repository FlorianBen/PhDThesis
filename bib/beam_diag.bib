The detector, which has a 75 mm active width, operates from residual gas in the beam vacuum system. It provides 1 mm rms spatial resolution and 1 ms time resolution in a 1 μA beam at 10−7 Torr. Using a microprocessor based scanning ADC, a sequence of ten profiles can be acquired in as little as 100 ms. The monitor could be applied in other stored or extracted beams where the amount of material seen by the beam must be minimized."

abstract = "The spallation neutron source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory is an accelerator-based, neutron-scattering facility. SNS uses a large-scale, high-energy superconducting linac (SCL) to provide high beam power utilizing hydrogen ion (H−) beams. For the diagnostics of high-brightness H− beams in the SCL, nonintrusive methods are preferred. This paper describes design, implementation, theoretical analysis, and experimental demonstration of a nonintrusive profile monitor system based on photodetachment, also known as laser wire, installed in the SNS SCL. The SNS laser wire system is the world's largest of its kind with a capability of measuring horizontal and vertical profiles of an operational H− beam at each of the 23 cryomodule stations along the SCL beam line by employing a single light source. Presently 9 laser wire stations have been commissioned that measure profiles of the H− beam at energy levels from 200MeV to 1GeV. The laser wire diagnostics has no moving parts inside the beam pipe, causes no contamination on the superconducting cavity, and can be run parasitically on an operational neutron production H− beam."
