abstract = "We describe a novel structure for a gaseous detector that is under development at Saclay. It consists of a two-stage parallet-plate avalanche chamber of small amplification gap (100 μm) combined with a conversion-drift space. It follows a fast removal of positive ions produced during the avalanche development. Fast signals (≤1 ns) are obtained during the collection of the electron avalanche on the anode microstrip plane. The positive ion signal has a duration of 100 ns. The fast evacuation of positive ions combined with the high granularity of the detector provide a high rate capability. Gas gains of up to 105 have been achieved."

The grid inefficiency correction is deduced from numerically calculated weighting potentials. A method to determine the correction factor experimentally is also presented. Experimental and calculated values of the correction factor are shown to be in good agreement."
