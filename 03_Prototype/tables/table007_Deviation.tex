  \caption[Example of deviation of the trajectory of a particle in an IPM]
  {Example of deviation of the trajectory of a particle in an IPM. A particle is released in the center of an IPM with a straight field everywhere, but in a certain range a parasitic field component is added and set to $1\,\mathrm{\%}$ of the main field. The 0 coordinate is the IPM center whereas the readout is located at distance of \(5 \, \mathrm{cm}\).}
