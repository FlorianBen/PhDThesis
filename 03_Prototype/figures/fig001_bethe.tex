	\caption[Typical mass stopping power plot a proton]{Typical mass stopping power plot for a proton. Here the mass stopping power is plotted for a proton in hydrogen and nitrogen. The calculation was done using the Bethe formula and has been cross-checked with the NIST PSTAR table which contains both computed and experimental values \cite{Seltzer1993}.}% The Bethe %equation gives correct results between \(0.2\ <\ \beta\gamma\ <\ 100\). %However at lower and higher energies the Bethe formula is no more reliable.}
