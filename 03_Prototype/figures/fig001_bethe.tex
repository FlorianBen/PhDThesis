	\caption[Typical mass stopping power plot for protons]{Typical mass stopping power plot for protons. Here the mass stopping power is plotted for proton in hydrogen and nitrogen.The calculation was done with respect to the Bethe formula and has been cross-checked with the NIST PSTAR table which contains both computed and experimental values \cite{Seltzer1993}. The Bethe equation gives relevant results between \(0.2\ <\ \beta\gamma\ <\ 100\). However at lower and higher energies the Bethe formula is no more reliable.}
